# Machine Learning Pipeline - Multi-Agent MLOps Orchestration

Design and implement a complete ML pipeline for: $ARGUMENTS

## Use this skill when

- Working on machine learning pipeline - multi-agent mlops orchestration tasks or workflows
- Needing guidance, best practices, or checklists for machine learning pipeline - multi-agent mlops orchestration

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to machine learning pipeline - multi-agent mlops orchestration
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Thinking

This workflow orchestrates multiple specialized agents to build a production-ready ML pipeline following modern MLOps best practices. The approach emphasizes:

- **Phase-based coordination**: Each phase builds upon previous outputs, with clear handoffs between agents
- **Modern tooling integration**: MLflow/W&B for experiments, Feast/Tecton for features, KServe/Seldon for serving
- **Production-first mindset**: Every component designed for scale, monitoring, and reliability
- **Reproducibility**: Version control for data, models, and infrastructure
- **Continuous improvement**: Automated retraining, A/B testing, and drift detection

The multi-agent approach ensures each aspect is handled by domain experts:
- Data engineers handle ingestion and quality
- Data scientists design features and experiments
- ML engineers implement training pipelines
- MLOps engineers handle production deployment
- Observability engineers ensure monitoring
