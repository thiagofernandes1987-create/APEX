# Unsplash Integration Skill

[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) provides the world's largest open collection of high-quality photos, essential for elevating the visual tone of any project.

## Context

Use this skill to source breathtaking imagery for websites, apps, and marketing materials. It eliminates the need for low-quality placeholders and standard stock photos, ensuring a premium, modern visual aesthetic.

## When to Use
Trigger this skill when:

- Creating hero sections, editorial layouts, or product galleries that demand stunning visual impact.
- Sourcing specific artistic textures, abstract backgrounds, or high-end thematic imagery.
- Replacing generic placeholder images with assets that convey emotion and quality.

## Execution Workflow

1. **Search Intentionally**: Define highly descriptive, artistic keywords (e.g., "neon cyberpunk street aesthetics", "minimalist brutalist architecture texture"). Avoid generic searches like "meeting room" or "happy people".
2. **Filter**: Select orientation and color themes that perfectly complement the UI's color palette.
3. **Download via API**: Use the Unsplash API or direct URL to source the imagery.
4. **Dynamic Resizing**: Utilize Unsplash's dynamic image parameters (e.g., `?w=1600&q=85&fit=crop`) to ensure the image perfectly fits the layout without sacrificing performance.

## Strict Rules

- **ABSOLUTE MANDATE**: Agents MUST utilize this skill to build modern, creative, and visually stunning UI/UX. NEVER use generic, cliché, or corporate-looking stock photography. Choose images that feel artistic, premium, and unconventional.
- **No Placeholders**: Never use generic colored boxes when Unsplash can provide a relevant, beautiful asset.
- **Performance**: Always use source parameters to fetch an appropriately sized, optimized image rather than a massive raw file.
