## Getting Started

When you run this skill, I'll ask for what I need:

**Required:**
- Company or contact name
- Meeting type (discovery, demo, negotiation, check-in, etc.)

**Helpful if you have it:**
- Who's attending (names and titles)
- Any context you want me to know (paste prior notes, emails, etc.)

If you've connected your CRM, email, or other tools, I'll pull context automatically and skip the questions.

---

## Connectors (Optional)

Connect your tools to supercharge this skill:

| Connector | What It Adds |
|-----------|--------------|
| **CRM** | Account details, contact history, open deals, recent activities |
| **Email** | Recent threads with the company, open questions, attachments shared |
| **Chat** | Internal chat discussions (e.g. Slack) about the account, colleague insights |
| **Transcripts** | Prior call recordings, topics covered, competitor mentions |
| **Calendar** | Auto-find the meeting, pull attendees and description |

> **No connectors?** No problem. Just tell me about the meeting and paste any context you have. I'll research the rest.

---

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Gather Context

**If connectors available:**
```
1. Calendar → Find upcoming meeting matching company name
   - Pull: title, time, attendees, description, attachments

2. CRM → Query account
   - Pull: account details, all contacts, open opportunities
   - Pull: last 10 activities, any account notes

3. Email → Search recent threads
   - Query: emails with company domain (last 30 days)
   - Extract: key topics, open questions, commitments

4. Chat → Search internal discussions
   - Query: company name mentions (last 30 days)
   - Extract: colleague insights, competitive intel

5. Transcripts → Find prior calls
   - Pull: call recordings with this account
   - Extract: key moments, objections raised, topics covered
```

**If no connectors:**
```
1. Ask user:
   - "What company are you meeting with?"
   - "What type of meeting is this?"
   - "Who's attending? (names and titles if you know)"
   - "Any context you want me to know? (paste notes, emails, etc.)"

2. Accept whatever they provide and work with it
```

### Step 2: Research Supplement

**Always run (web search):**
```
1. "[Company] news" — last 30 days
2. "[Company] funding" — recent announcements
3. "[Company] leadership" — executive changes
4. "[Company] + [industry] trends" — relevant context
5. Attendee LinkedIn profiles — background research
```

### Step 3: Synthesize & Generate

```
1. Combine all sources into unified context
2. Identify gaps in understanding → generate discovery questions
3. Anticipate objections based on stage and history
4. Create suggested agenda tailored to meeting type
5. Output formatted prep brief
```

## Tips for Better Prep

1. **More context = better prep** — Paste emails, notes, anything you have
2. **Name the attendees** — Even just titles help me research
3. **State your goal** — "I want to get them to agree to a pilot"
4. **Flag concerns** — "They mentioned budget is tight"
