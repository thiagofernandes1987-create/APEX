# Draft Content

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../../CONNECTORS.md).

Generate marketing content drafts tailored to a specific content type, audience, and brand voice.

## Trigger

User runs `/draft-content` or asks to draft, write, or create marketing content.

## Inputs

Gather the following from the user. If not provided, ask before proceeding:

1. **Content type** — one of:
   - Blog post
   - Social media post (specify platform: LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Instagram, Facebook)
   - Email newsletter
   - Landing page copy
   - Press release
   - Case study

2. **Topic** — the subject or theme of the content

3. **Target audience** — who this content is for (role, industry, seniority, pain points)

4. **Key messages** — 2-4 main points or takeaways to communicate

5. **Tone** — e.g., authoritative, conversational, inspirational, technical, witty (optional if brand voice is configured)

6. **Length** — target word count or format constraint (e.g., "1000 words", "280 characters", "3 paragraphs")

## Brand Voice

- If the user has a brand voice configured in their local settings file, apply it automatically. Inform the user that brand voice settings are being applied.
- If no brand voice is configured, ask: "Do you have brand voice guidelines you'd like me to follow? If not, I'll use a neutral professional tone."
- Apply the specified or default tone consistently throughout the draft.

## Content Generation by Type

### Blog Post
- Engaging headline (provide 2-3 options)
- Introduction with a hook (question, statistic, bold statement, or story)
- 3-5 organized sections with descriptive subheadings
- Supporting points, examples, or data references in each section
- Conclusion with a clear call to action
- SEO considerations: suggest a primary keyword, include it in the headline and first paragraph, use related keywords in subheadings

### Social Media Post
- Platform-appropriate format and length
- Hook in the first line
- Hashtag suggestions (3-5 relevant hashtags)
- Call to action or engagement prompt
- Emoji usage appropriate to brand and platform
- If LinkedIn: professional framing, paragraph breaks for readability
- If Twitter/X: concise, punchy, within character limit
- If Instagram: visual-first language, story-driven, hashtag block

### Email Newsletter
- Subject line (provide 2-3 options with open-rate considerations)
- Preview text
- Greeting
- Body sections with clear hierarchy
- Call to action button text
- Sign-off
- Unsubscribe note reminder

### Landing Page Copy
- Headline and subheadline
- Hero section copy
- Value propositions (3-4 benefit-driven bullets or sections)
- Social proof placeholder (suggest testimonial or stat placement)
- Primary and secondary CTAs
- FAQ section suggestions
- SEO: meta title and meta description suggestions

### Press Release
- Headline following press release conventions
- Dateline and location
- Lead paragraph (who, what, when, where, why)
- Supporting quotes (provide placeholder guidance)
- Company boilerplate placeholder
- Media contact placeholder
- Standard press release formatting

### Case Study
- Title emphasizing the result
- Customer overview (industry, size, challenge)
- Challenge section
- Solution section (what was implemented)
- Results section with metrics (prompt user for data)
- Customer quote placeholder
- Call to action

## SEO Considerations (for web content)

For blog posts, landing pages, and other web-facing content:
- Suggest a primary keyword based on the topic
- Recommend keyword placement: headline, first paragraph, subheadings, meta description
- Suggest internal and external linking opportunities
- Recommend a meta description (under 160 characters)
- Note image alt text opportunities

## Output

Present the draft with clear formatting. After the draft, include:
- A brief note on what brand voice and tone were applied
- Any SEO recommendations (for web content)
- Suggestions for next steps (e.g., "Review with your team", "Add customer quotes", "Pair with a visual")

Ask: "Would you like me to revise any section, adjust the tone, or create a variation for a different channel?"
