### Installing Hooks

```bash
cp hooks/hooks.json .claude/hooks.json
cp -r hooks/scripts/ .claude/hooks/scripts/
```

### Quick Setup with cc-safe-setup

Install 8 production-tested safety hooks in one command — destructive command blocker, branch push protection, secret leak prevention, syntax validation, and more:

```bash
npx cc-safe-setup
```
