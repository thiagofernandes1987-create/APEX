## 2.0.36 (2026-03-31) (pre-release)

### Fixed

- Added service name validation for Azure AI Search tools. [#2307](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2307)

## 2.0.35 (2026-03-30) (pre-release)

### Changed

- Added skill name and tool name validation to the `plugin-telemetry` tool. Skill names are validated against an allowlist to prevent logging of customer-defined custom skill names. Tool names are validated by stripping known client prefixes (Claude Code, VS Code, Copilot CLI) and matching against registered commands or area names, with normalized names logged for consistent telemetry. Added an allowlist for Azure extension tools that are not azmcp commands but still tracked. Expanded the plugin file-reference allowlist with additional azure-enterprise-infra-planner reference paths. [[#2291](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2291)]
- Refactored `PluginTelemetryCommand` to use constructor injection for allowlist providers and lazy resolution of `ICommandFactory` via `IServiceProvider` to avoid circular dependency during startup. [[#2291](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2291)]

### Fixed

- Configured the right audience based on Cloud configuration when creating SDK clients for tools in:
  - AppConfiguration [[#2287](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2287)]
  - Container Registry [[#2286](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2286)]
  - Monitor Query [[#2285](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2285)]
  - Search [[#2283](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2283)]
- Fixed JSON deserialization issues for `resourcehealth` events with timezone-less datetime values. [[#2293](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2293)]

## 2.0.34 (2026-03-27) (pre-release)

### Added

- Added `--dangerously-disable-retry-limits` server start option to bypass retry policy bounds enforcement when explicitly required. [[#2239](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2239)]

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Removed support for custom URL-based authority hosts in the `--cloud` option. The option now accepts only well-known cloud names. Unrecognized values now throw an `ArgumentException` instead of defaulting to the public cloud. Supported values are: [[#2257](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2257)]
  - `AzureCloud`
  - `AzurePublicCloud`
  - `Public`
  - `AzurePublic`
  - `AzureChinaCloud`
  - `China`
  - `AzureChina`
  - `AzureUSGovernment`
  - `AzureUSGovernmentCloud`
  - `USGov`
  - `USGovernment`
- Enforced upper bounds on retry policy values to prevent excessively large retry configurations. [[#2239](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2239)]
- Bumped `@azure/msal-browser` to 5.2.0+ to comply with Component Governance requirements. [[#2260](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2260)]

- Fixed Cosmos DB cache key generation to include the authentication method, preventing incorrect client reuse across authentication types. [[#2217](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2217)]
- Fixed validation gap in `BaseAzureResourceService` where the `additionalFilter` parameter could be concatenated into Resource Graph queries without validation. Pipe operators are now rejected. [[#2217](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2217)]
- Added input validation for ledger names in `ConfidentialLedgerService` to ensure only valid characters are accepted. [[#2211](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2211)]
- Fixed elicitation for GitHub Copilot CLI by updating from `UntitledSingleSelectEnumSchema` to `TitledSingleSelectEnumSchema`. [[#2253](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2253)]
- Fixed incorrect SignalR caching where runtime results were not stored in the cache, causing every request to re-fetch instead of returning cached data. [[#2254](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2254)]
- Added `CacheKeyBuilder` to construct cache keys using characters disallowed in Azure resource and subscription names, preventing cache collisions in multi-client remote scenarios. [[#2259](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2259)]
- Added vault name validation in `KeyVaultService` to prevent unsafe input from being interpolated into Key Vault and Managed HSM URIs. [[#2238](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2238)]

## 2.0.33 (2026-03-25) (pre-release)

### Added

- Updated secret elicitation to require explicit user confirmation before proceeding with sensitive operations. [[#2197](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2197)]

### Changed

- Extended elicitations/user consent prompts to cover destructive operations (delete, modify, create) in addition to secret operations, and consolidated both into a single prompt to avoid duplicate confirmation. [[#2208](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2208)]

### Fixed

- Added IPv4 format validation and blocked dangerous IP ranges in the `sql_server_firewall-rule_create` command to prevent overly permissive firewall rules. [[#2206](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2206)]
- Improved `HttpRequestException` handling to return the actual HTTP status code when available instead of defaulting to `503 Service Unavailable`. [[#2200](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2200)]

## 2.0.32 (2026-03-24) (pre-release)

### Added

- Added blocklist validation for security-sensitive PostgreSQL server parameters (audit logging, TLS/SSL, authentication, shared libraries, row-level security) in the `server param set` command to prevent accidental weakening of server security. [[#2164](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2164)]

- Removed structured logging of the full options payload from the `sql_server_create` command to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive values. [[#2158](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2158)]
- Updated Docker release pipeline to publish additional minor version tags (e.g., `2.0`, `2.0-amd64`, `2.0-arm64`) allowing consumers to pin to a minor release stream. [[#2144](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2144)]

### Fixed

- Fixed PostgreSQL and MySQL server name validation to require allowed Azure domain suffixes when a fully qualified domain name is provided. [[#2159](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2159)]
- Fixed Cosmos DB credential authentication to strictly honor the requested authentication method instead of falling back to account-key authentication. [[#2162](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2162)]
- Fixed snapshot lookup in the `FileShares` namespace to use exact resource ID matching instead of substring matching. [[#2168](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2168)]
- Improved Cosmos DB query validator to detect a broader range of boolean tautology patterns. [[#2171](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2171)]
- Fixed the `sql_server_create` command to default `--public-network-access` to `Disabled` for secure-by-default server creation. [[#2181](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2181)]

Non out-of-the-box types like `vector` cannot be deserialized and will now report a clear error message indicating which column caused the issue and an action plan so AI agents can recover from it. [[#1024](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1024)]
- Fixed exit code when invoking `--help` flag. Commands like `tools list --help` now correctly return exit code `0` instead of `1` when successfully displaying help output. [[#1118](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1118)]

## 2.0.3 (2025-11-11) (pre-release)

### Added

- Added an Azure AI Best Practices toolset providing comprehensive guidance for building AI apps with Microsoft Foundry and Microsoft Agent Framework. Includes model selection guidance, SDK recommendations, and implementation patterns for agent development. [[#1031](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1031)]
- Added support for text-to-speech synthesis via the command `speech_tts_synthesize`. [[#902](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/902)]

### Changed

- **Breaking:** PostgreSQL MCP tools now require SSL and verify the server's full certificate chain before creating database connections. This SSL mode provides both `eavesdropping protection` and `man-in-the-middle protection`. See [SSL Mode VerifyFull](https://www.npgsql.org/doc/security.html?tabs=tabid-1#encryption-ssltls) for more details. [[#1023](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1023)]
- Refactored duplicate elicitation handling code in `CommandFactoryToolLoader` and `NamespaceToolLoader` into a shared `BaseToolLoader.HandleSecretElicitationAsync` method. [[#1028](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1028)]

### Fixed

- Updated a codepath `--mode namespace` where `learn=true` wouldn't always result in agent learning happening. [[#1122](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1122)]
- Use the correct `Assembly` to find `Version` for telemetry. [[#1122](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1122)]

## 2.0.2 (2025-11-06) (pre-release)

### Added

- Added support for speech recognition from an audio file with Fast Transcription via the command `azmcp_speech_stt_recognize`. [[#1054](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1054)]
- Added support for User-Assigned Managed Identity via the `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` environment variable. [[#1033](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1033)]
- Added the following features for deploying as a `Remote MCP Server`:
    - Added support for HTTP transport, including both incoming and outgoing authentication. Incoming authentication uses Entra ID, while outgoing authentication can either use Entra On-Behalf-Of (OBO) or the authentication configured in the host environment. [[#1020](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1020)]
    - Added support for the `--dangerously-disable-http-incoming-auth` command-line option to disable the built-in incoming authentication. Use this option only if you plan to provide your own incoming authentication mechanism, and with caution, as it exposes the server to unauthenticated access. [[#1037](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1037)]
- Enhanced the `tools list` command with new filtering and output options: [[#741](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/741)]
  - Added the `--namespace` option to filter tools by one or more service namespaces (e.g., 'storage', 'keyvault').
  - Added the `--name-only` option to return only tool names without descriptions or metadata.
- Added the following Microsoft Foundry tools: [[#945](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/945)]
  - `foundry_agents_create`: Create a new Microsoft Foundry agent.
  - `foundry_agents_get-sdk-sample`: Get a code sample to interact with a Foundry Agent using the Microsoft Foundry SDK.
  - `foundry_threads_create`: Create a new Microsoft Foundry Agent Thread.
  - `foundry_threads_list`: List all Microsoft Foundry Agent Threads.
  - `foundry_threads_get-messages`: Get messages in a Microsoft Foundry Agent Thread.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Renamed the `--namespaces` option to `--namespace-mode` in the `tools list` command for better clarity when listing top-level service namespaces. [[#741](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/741)]
- Telemetry:
  - Added `ToolId` into telemetry, based on `IBaseCommand.Id`, a unique GUID for each command. [[#1018](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1018)]
  - Added support for exporting telemetry to OTLP exporters by configuring the environment variable `AZURE_MCP_ENABLE_OTLP_EXPORTER=true`. [[#1018](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1018)]
  - Disabled telemetry for the HTTP transport. [[#1072](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1072)]

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue that spawned child processes per namespace for consolidated mode. [[#1002](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1002)]
- Improved the agent learning experience by ignoring the `command` parameter, which resulted in neither learning nor a tool call to happen. Learning is now always invoked when `learn=true` is passed. [[#1057](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1057)]

## 2.0.1 (2025-10-29) (pre-release)

- Initial beta release to validate updated release infrastructure and versioning strategy. No functional changes from 1.x series.

## 0.8.0 (2025-09-18)

### Added

- Added the `--insecure-disable-elicitation` server startup switch. When enabled, the server will bypass user confirmation (elicitation) for tools marked as handling secrets and execute them immediately. This is **INSECURE** and meant only for controlled automation scenarios (e.g., CI or disposable test environments) because it removes a safety barrier that helps prevent accidental disclosure of sensitive data. [[#486](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/486)]

  - `azmcp_keyvault_key_get`
  - `azmcp_keyvault_secret_get`

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Redesigned how conditionally required options are handled.

- **Breaking:** Removed Azure CLI (`az`) and Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) extension tools to reduce complexity and focus on native Azure service operations. [[#404](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/404)].

### Fixed

- Marked the `secret` hint of `azmcp_keyvault_secret_create` tool to "true". [[#430](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/430)]
