# Changelog

## 0.2.96

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.96

## 0.2.95

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.95

## 0.2.94

- Fixed `getContextUsage()` to include agents passed via `options.agents` in the `agents` breakdown
- Fixed CJK and other multibyte text being corrupted with U+FFFD in stream-json input/output when chunk boundaries split a UTF-8 sequence
- Fixed MCP server child processes not being cleaned up when an SDK `query()` session ends
- Fixed a failed error-report write crashing the SDK process with `unhandledRejection`
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.94

## 0.2.93

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.93

## 0.2.92

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.92

## 0.2.91

- Added optional `terminal_reason` field to result messages, exposing why the query loop terminated (`completed`, `aborted_tools`, `max_turns`, `blocking_limit`, etc.)
- Added `'auto'` to the public `PermissionMode` type
- Changed `sandbox` option to default `failIfUnavailable` to `true` when `enabled: true` is passed — `query()` will emit an error result and exit if sandbox dependencies are missing, instead of silently running unsandboxed. Set `failIfUnavailable: false` to allow graceful degradation.
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.91

## 0.2.90

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.90

## 0.2.89

- Added `startup()` to pre-warm the CLI subprocess before `query()`, making the first query ~20x faster when startup cost can be paid upfront
- Added `includeSystemMessages` option to `getSessionMessages()` to optionally include system messages in session history
- Added `listSubagents()` and `getSubagentMessages()` functions to retrieve subagent conversation history from sessions
- Added `includeHookEvents` option to enable hook lifecycle messages (`hook_started`, `hook_progress`, `hook_response`) for all hook event types
- Fixed `ERR_STREAM_WRITE_AFTER_END` errors when single-turn queries with SDK MCP servers or hooks have control responses arriving after the result message
- Fixed Zod v4 field `.describe()` metadata being dropped from `createSdkMcpServer` tool schemas
- Fixed `side_question` returning null on resume before the first turn completes
- Fixed `settingSources` empty array causing `--setting-sources ""` to consume the next CLI flag
- Fixed error result messages (`error_during_execution`, `error_max_turns`, `error_max_budget_usd`) to correctly set `is_error: true` with descriptive messages
- Fixed MCP servers getting permanently stuck in a failed state after a connection race — they now retry on the next message

## 0.2.87

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.87

## 0.2.86

- Added `getContextUsage()` control method to retrieve a breakdown of context window usage by category
- Made `session_id` optional in `SDKUserMessage` type — callers no longer need to provide a session ID when sending user messages, as the SDK assigns one automatically

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.86

## 0.2.85

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.84

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.80

## 0.2.79

- Added `queued_to_running` status to `AgentToolOutput` — returned when `Agent({resume})` targets a still-running agent
- Improved error messages when the Claude Code subprocess returns an error result — the SDK now surfaces the actual error text instead of a generic "process exited with code 1"
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.75

## 0.2.74

- Added `renameSession(sessionId, title, opts?)` for renaming session files
- Fixed `import type` from `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk/sdk-tools` failing under NodeNext/Bundler module resolution (missing exports map entry since v0.2.69)

- Fixed `type: "http"` MCP servers failing with HTTP 406 "Not Acceptable" on Streamable HTTP servers that strictly enforce the `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream` header

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.70

## 0.2.69

- Added `toolConfig.askUserQuestion.previewFormat` option to configure the content format (`'markdown'` or `'html'`) for the `preview` field on AskUserQuestion tool options. The `preview` field and `annotations` output are now exposed in the public SDK types.
- Added `supportsFastMode` field to `ModelInfo` indicating whether a model supports fast mode
- Added `agent_id` (for subagents) and `agent_type` (for subagents and `--agent`) fields to hook events
- Fixed SDK-mode MCP servers (registered via `sdkMcpServers` in the `initialize` control request) getting disconnected when background plugin installation refreshes project MCP config
- Fixed breaking change: `system:init` and `result` events now emit `'Task'` as the Agent tool name again (reverted from `'Agent'`, which was an unintentional breaking change in a patch release). The wire name will migrate to `'Agent'` in the next minor release.
- Fixed control responses with malformed `updatedPermissions` from SDK hosts blocking tool calls with a ZodError; the invalid field is now stripped and a warning is logged instead.
- Improved memory usage of `getSessionMessages()` for large sessions with compacted history

## 0.1.0

- **Merged prompt options**: The `customSystemPrompt` and `appendSystemPrompt` fields have been merged into a single `systemPrompt` field for simpler configuration
- **No default system prompt**: The Claude Code system prompt is no longer included by default, giving you full control over agent behavior. To use the Claude Code system prompt, explicitly set:
- **No filesystem settings by default**: Settings files (`settings.json`, `CLAUDE.md`), slash commands, and subagents are no longer loaded automatically. This ensures SDK applications have predictable behavior independent of local filesystem configurations
- **Explicit settings control**: Use the new `settingSources` field to specify which settings locations to load: `["user", "project", "local"]`
- **Programmatic subagents**: Subagents can now be defined inline in code using the `agents` option, enabling dynamic agent creation without filesystem dependencies. [Learn more](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/subagents)
- **Session forking**: Resume sessions with the new `forkSession` option to branch conversations and explore different approaches from the same starting point. [Learn more](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/sessions)
- **Granular settings control**: The `settingSources` option gives you fine-grained control over which filesystem settings to load, improving isolation for CI/CD, testing, and production deployments
- Comprehensive documentation now available in the [API Guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview)
- New guides for [Custom Tools](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/custom-tools), [Permissions](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/permissions), [Session Management](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/sessions), and more
