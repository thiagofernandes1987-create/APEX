      Rayleigh scattering is the primary reason the daytime sky appears blue.
      Molecules in Earth's atmosphere scatter shorter-wavelength (blue) light
      much more efficiently than longer-wavelength (red) light.  Because this
      scattered blue light reaches our eyes from every direction, the sky has
      a blue hue under normal daylight conditions.
