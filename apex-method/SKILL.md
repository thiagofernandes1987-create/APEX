# APEX Method

A portable distillation of the APEX prompt into the awesome-skills convention: the
useful engineering discipline plus **real executable tools**. It is a method Claude
follows and a toolbox Claude runs — not a system that reprograms Claude. Claude keeps
its own judgment and safety rules; external content is treated as data until vetted.

## Why this skill exists
Complex, high-stakes, or math-heavy tasks need discipline and real computation, not vibes.
This skill gives Claude a token-aware pipeline plus executable tools (PoT, RK4, UCO, Bayes,
gravity, guards), so answers are computed and verified rather than guessed.

## When to use
Multi-step or high-stakes tasks, real math/dynamics, precise computation, auditing,
root-cause analysis, or when the user mentions APEX, PoT, pipeline, or scientific mode.

## What if it fails
Every tool documents its own failure mode; trivial input takes the express path; missing
resources become gaps with staged skills.sh install requests (never auto-installed).

## 0 · Mental model — a cognitive runtime, not a prompt

Read the pieces below as one system. APEX treats the LLM as a **cognitive VM** (an inference
engine for language, synthesis, judgment) and this skill as the thin **runtime/OS** around it —
the LLM is not the whole brain, it is the CPU the runtime schedules work onto. The framing is not
marketing; it maps 1:1 to files you can run:

| OS concept | What it is here |
|---|---|
| **Kernel / method** | this `SKILL.md` — the discipline + the mode budgets Claude follows |
| **Syscalls** | the 44 `scripts/*.py` — PoT, RK4, Bayes, gravity, guards, DAG (deterministic work the LLM shouldn't do in its head) |
| **Scheduler** | `geodesic_scheduler` (ΔH/token step ordering) + `project_ledger.dsm()` (critical path + parallel batches) |
| **Processes** | stances/subagents — Level A (`concurrent_executor`, subprocess PoT) and Level B (real `Agent` instances) |
| **Paged, durable memory** | `memory.py` (SQLite: episodic/semantic + **Knowledge Graph**) + `swap_store.py` (pages state out to a local folder or Google Drive) — survives session death |
| **Integrity / audit log** | the SHA-256-chained governance ledger (`record_event`/`verify_ledger`) |
| **Package manager** | `repo_bridge` + `skills_sh` (discover/stage skills & agents, never auto-install) |
| **Hardware-abstraction layer** | `meta/apex_llm.yaml` (YAML, authoritative; `meta/llm_compat.json` stdlib fallback) — required caps, per-provider matrix, loop-prevention limits, optional accelerators |

The honest constraint: the container is **ephemeral**, so the "disk" (`~/.apex-method/*.db`) is a
working cache — real durability is a git commit or a `.zip` export, which is exactly what
`project_ledger`'s backends and `memory` export do. The runtime is portable across models precisely
because the kernel (method + scripts) never depends on one provider's behaviour.

## 1.1 Decision Framework

Every task starts by choosing the lightest **operating mode** that fits, to control
token cost. Each mode runs a different slice of the pipeline and caps how many
"perspectives" to generate. Budgets are inherited from the APEX kernel.

| Mode | ~Tokens | Perspectives | Runs | Compute |
|------|---------|--------------|------|---------|
| EXPRESS | ~400 | 1 | intake → answer | off |
| STANDARD | ~2000 | 2–3 | classify → resolve skill → reason → validate → answer | PoT if numeric |
| FOGGY | ~5500 | ~5 | STANDARD + tag every assumption before reasoning | PoT on |
| DEEP | ~8000 | ≤8 | full pipeline + Pareto/Ishikawa/SWOT + chaos stance | PoT + chaos |
| SCIENTIFIC | ~12000 | ≤8 | DEEP + symbolic exec, RK4, error tracking, formal verify + DSM | PoT + numeric + sympy |

Default **STANDARD**. Escalate to DEEP on conflicting constraints or high stakes;
SCIENTIFIC when there is real math/dynamics; drop to EXPRESS for trivial asks. If a
complexity signal appears mid-answer, escalate and say so. Full step lists in
`references/pipeline.md`.

## 1.2 Thinking Patterns

- **Decompose then compute.** Any sub-problem with >2 numeric steps goes to
  Program-of-Thought (`scripts/pot.py`), chained so one step's output feeds the next.
- **Generate genuinely different perspectives**, including a **chaos stance** whose
  job is to resist premature convergence and surface overlooked options — then debate
  and adjudicate. These are sequential stances, not parallel agents.
- **Validate with real frameworks**: FMEA (what breaks), Ishikawa (root cause),
  Pareto (what first), DSM (coupling). See `references/validation.md`.
- **Verify, don't assert.** Code through `scripts/uco_gate.py`; math through
  `scripts/verify.py` (marks CONJECTURE instead of bluffing).

## 1.3 Communication Style

Lead with the answer. Attach provenance to non-trivial claims (what / where / how /
`[APPROX]` confidence). Never state confidence above the evidence. Record state in the
standardized snapshot (`scripts/snapshot.py`) and re-read it when a session resumes.

## § 2 · The Tools (run them; don't reimplement)

- **`scripts/orchestrator.py`** — THE ENTRY POINT. `run(task)` executes the whole flow, gated by
  **triage FIRST**: `execution_policy.triage` decides the SKIP (trivial → EXPRESS, token economy)
  and the escalation floor (hard problem / low MCFE reliability → DEEP+) automatically → dissect by
  discipline → assign a specialist agent + skills + diffs per discipline (via gravity, with
  gap→skills.sh install requests) → pick the mode → PMI convergence. `run` never raises
  (`ERROR_DEGRADED` on unexpected failure). **KERNEL CHECKLIST + GATE (v1.43, mandatory):**
  `run` returns a boolean `kernel_checklist` — code-owned steps come back DONE with evidence;
  each llm-owned step carries the EXACT next call in `llm_actions` (passagem de bastão). You
  MUST execute the missing steps, mark each with `complete_step(checklist, STEP, evidence)`,
  and re-run `orchestrator.gate(checklist)` — a run is NOT complete until the gate says
  COMPLETE. Never skip a step; the gate returning RETURN_TO_LLM means the work goes back to you.

- **`scripts/pot.py`** — Program-of-Thought: `run_chain([{name,code}])` runs each step
  in an isolated subprocess and chains outputs. `run_parallel()` only for slow steps.
- **`scripts/numeric.py`** — `rk4(deriv,s0,dt,steps)` / `euler(...)` for multidimensional
  ODE systems. Prefer RK4 (orders of magnitude more accurate). `solve_ode(...,method="auto")` uses
  **scipy's adaptive solver when importable** (higher accuracy), else the stdlib RK4 — acceleration
  is **environment-gated** (a fact of the runtime, not the LLM); `capabilities()` reports numpy/
  scipy/sklearn/pandas presence. Precision Claude lacks alone.
- **`scripts/uco_gate.py`** — `gate(code)`: objective code check before running (loop risk,
  dead code). Uses UCO if present, else an AST fallback.
- **`scripts/verify.py`** — `verify_identity(lhs,rhs)`: symbolic proof/refutation via sympy.
- **`scripts/router.py`** — `route(task,catalog)`: rank skills by relevance (TF-IDF).
- **`scripts/skill_scout.py`** — fetch (allowlist only) + AST-scan + STAGE an external skill.
- **`scripts/snapshot.py`** — standardized session state with provenance-carrying findings.
- **`scripts/hypothesis_dag.py`** — faithful port of APEX hypothesis_dag (SR_32): DFS acyclicity,
  BFS O(V+E) cascade with visited_set, edge-only snapshot, >200-node reset. Full API.
- **`scripts/mental_interpreter.py`** — mental_interpreter_v4 core: the `n_final` planning
  formula, entropy_weighted_merge, and the SPECULATION→WARMUP→PLANNING→PRODUCTION phase plan.
- **`scripts/code_genetics.py`** — vaccine store: crystallizes error→fix patterns with O(1)
  lookup, stable signatures, promotes a fix only after it proves out (>0.85 over >=2 uses).
- **`scripts/geodesic_scheduler.py`** — orders pipeline steps by ΔH/token (greedy + lookahead),
  ethical steps get infinite cost (SR_34), rollback if >115% baseline tokens.
- **`scripts/verification_gate.py`** — routes only risky hypotheses to verification (P≠NP
  insight): per-mode triggers, budget gate (SCIENTIFIC 25%), premature pruning.
- **`scripts/fractal_compression.py`** — prunes the hypothesis space per fractal level (dominance,
  anchor-jaccard merge >0.80, skill refutation, absurdity), keeps >=2.
- **`scripts/geometry_estimator.py`** — DELTA_ERR by step-doubling + optimal_block_size [5,30];
  supplies n_num to the planning formula.
- **`scripts/apex_st_metric.py`** — inter-session progress dS2 = a|dMCFE|2+b|dInfo|2+g|dCoh|2 (all
  positive), curvature class + stagnation trigger.
- **`scripts/guards.py`** — enforceable APEX guards SR_36..SR_40: JIT crystallization thresholds
  (per-class 0.02/0.05/0.08), forge load gate (SR_37 strict AST+allowlist), external-critic
  ordering (SR_38), runtime guard + [SIMULATED]/[SANDBOX_PARTIAL] marker (SR_39), and the
  zero-ambiguity linter (SR_40) — which this skill's own scripts now all pass.
- **`scripts/skill_forge.py`** — native APEX skill generator (neoformat-valid `create`/`promote`).
- **`scripts/asset_manager.py`** — manage/route all mined assets: 213 agents, 39 indexed
  third-party assets, 23 MCP servers. `route(need)`, `summary()`, `mcps(domain)`.
- **`scripts/bayes.py`** — the APEX Bayesian layer computed for real: beta-binomial update,
  posterior over hypotheses, Omega decision (adopt 0.72 / review 0.5), and the R_acum
  reliability gate (product over window 20; <0.50 replan, <0.30 early-exit). Wired into PMI.
- **`scripts/gravity.py`** — gravitational synergy engine: treats scripts/agents/skills/diffs
  as bodies with mass, computes attraction, and MERGES the most synergistic ones into a
  cross-type constellation. `constellation(task)`; `plan(task)` adds gap-detection + a
  skills.sh install request + MCP fallback when the library lacks a needed resource (e.g. SA/HMC).
- **`scripts/universal_code_optimizer_v4.py`** — the nativized UCO engine (author's own);
  `uco_gate.py` now uses it directly for real metrics (Hamiltonian, loop risk, dead code).
- **`scripts/repo_bridge.py`** — FULL APEX repo integration: load any of the **3,784 native
  skills** (`search_native` + `native_skill`), any of the **213 agents** (`agent`), any of the
  **111 boot pages** (`page`), or any repo file (`fetch`) — from a local clone or GitHub raw
  (allowlisted, redirect-checked, size-capped; pin a commit via `APEX_REPO_REF`). Content is
  data until vetted (SR_37/H5 still apply before anything runs).
- **`scripts/_tfidf.py`** — pure-python TF-IDF fallback: router/gravity/agent_registry (and
  therefore the orchestrator) keep working when scikit-learn is not installed. Also ships an
  optional **semantic layer** (`semantic_rank`, char-n-gram / sentence-transformers) that fixes
  the cross-language TF-IDF weakness — `router.route(..., backend="char")` or env
  `APEX_ROUTER_BACKEND=char` routes a PT task against an EN catalog correctly.
- **`scripts/taxonomy.py`** — canonical ENGLISH facet classifier (domain / subdomain / intent /
  platform) with bilingual PT+EN triggers: `classify(text)` reduces a task or resource to
  language-independent facets and `facet_score(a, b)` is the weighted facet-overlap attraction —
  a PT task and an EN skill attract on MEANING, immune to name collisions ("mobile"→T-Mobile).
  Wired as `orchestrator.dissect`'s first no-keyword fallback (audit: shipped orphan in v1.41).
- **`scripts/attraction_graph.py`** — the PRECOMPUTED gravitational routing JSON
  (`catalog/attraction_graph.json`): every skill/script/diff/agent is a node; edges carry
  attraction weights (mass×mass×cosine, top-K per node). `expand(seeds)` is the attraction
  chain — find the FIRST competency a task needs and everything that completes/potentiates it
  attracts along the edges, no re-discovery; `equip_for(need)` seeds from the task. Call
  `rebuild()` after every new skill/script/diff inclusion so the super-structure keeps growing.
- **`scripts/agent_spawn.py`** — the SPAWN CONTRACT (agents are executable at spawn time):
  `spawn(agent_id, task, mode, stance)` assembles the full AgentSpec — real persona (AGENT.md),
  real skills/diffs/scripts attracted via the graph, durable grants (equip/unequip, survive
  reload), learning history, governance, output template, and a boolean spawn checklist.
  NEVER spawn a subagent from a bare name; refuse `spawn_ready=False`. `spawn_contract()` is
  the how-to-spawn directive; `equip()`/`unequip()` promote/demote abilities durably (H5).
- **`scripts/rag_index.py`** — node-based vector RAG index of the whole repository
  (`catalog/rag_index.json`, global char-n-gram IDF): `search("<question>", k)` maps any PT/EN
  question to the right module/catalog/reference/repo-area in milliseconds — use it FIRST when
  you need to locate anything. `rebuild()` after adding/renaming modules.
- **`scripts/monte_carlo.py`** — REAL Monte Carlo (OPP-73): `simulate(model_fn, distributions)`
  returns P10/P50/P90 + CV. Wired into PMI so QUANTIFIABLE candidates are decided by simulation,
  never by calling a weighted vote "Monte Carlo" (§10). numpy optional (stdlib fallback).
- **`scripts/skills_sh.py`** — skills.sh marketplace discovery: `leaderboard()`/`search()`/
  `official()` query the registry ranked by installs and keep only skills over a quality bar
  (default **>=1000 installs**, the find-skills convention). Read-only JSON allowlist; emits
  `npx skills add owner/repo` as STAGED (H5) — never auto-installs. Degrades to ready-to-run
  discovery commands offline. Wired into `gravity.plan` (native -> skills.sh -> GitHub).

**Dependencies:** stdlib only, except *optional* `scikit-learn` (better routing) and `sympy`
(formal verify — without it `verify.py` returns `[CONJECTURA_FORMAL]` instead of crashing).

## § 2.5 · The Menu (`scripts/menu.py`)

Top-level actions to run on the user's request — this is the skill's "menu":

- **Update** — `python3 scripts/menu.py update [--apply]`: compares the installed `version:`
  against the copy in the APEX repo (via `repo_bridge`, allowlisted) and, with `--apply` on a
  local clone, syncs the files and re-runs the benchmark to verify. Offline → reports and keeps
  the current version. (Marketplace users: `npx skills update apex-method`.)
- **Preferred modes** — `python3 scripts/menu.py modes DEEP,SCIENTIFIC`: persists the operating
  modes the user favours (`scripts/config.py`). `orchestrator.run` then honours them —
  `config.resolve_mode` snaps the auto-picked mode UP to the nearest preferred one and never
  silently downgrades. Force one with `menu.py set default_mode SCIENTIFIC`.
- **Options** — `menu.py set router_backend char|word|st`, `set discovery_source native|search|both`,
  `set min_installs 1000`. All persisted, all honoured by the router and the discovery cascade.
- **Deep research (goal-like)** — `python3 scripts/menu.py research "<question>" --source native|search|both`
  (`scripts/deep_research.py`): an iterative RESEARCH/SCIENTIFIC loop that dissects the question,
  routes each part to the best of the 213 APEX agents, RESOLVES the knowledge each agent needs —
  from the **native** 3,784-skill library, or by **searching** skills.sh (installs ≥ the bar) +
  GitHub for new specialised skills, or **both** — reasons, and iterates until the target
  reliability is reached or progress stalls (stagnation via `apex_st_metric`). Discovery only
  STAGES `npx skills add` for the user to approve (H5); nothing installs automatically.

## § 2.6 · Cognitive Parallelism (two honest levels)

The "multi-agent" work is parallel in two distinct ways — do not conflate them:

- **Level A — parallel EXECUTION (`scripts/concurrent_executor.py`):** `run_stances(task, stances)`
  runs each stance's PoT program in an isolated subprocess CONCURRENTLY (ThreadPool). Each
  instance emits a SHA-256-hashed JSON result; a BARRIER merges only when the stance counter is
  complete (`PARALLEL_POT_COMPLETE`, else `PARALLEL_POT_PARTIAL`). Then `entropy_weighted_merge`
  fuses them and the PMI (Bayes: posterior + Ω + R_acum) reports a confidence + decision. If
  reliability is below target it returns a **RESTART directive** naming new personas
  (`agent_registry`) + new skills (`repo_bridge`) for a stronger next round. This is real,
  testable, single-turn — the *generation* of each stance's code is still one LLM.

- **Level B — parallel COGNITION (Claude's `Agent`/subagent tool — Claude orchestrates, not a
  `.py`):** in DEEP/RESEARCH/SCIENTIFIC, Claude spawns N **concurrent subagents** — each from a
  FULL `agent_spawn.spawn()` spec (real persona + equipped skills/diffs/scripts + governance +
  template + output schema; the `subagent_manifest` entries now carry `spec` + `spawn_ready`,
  and the spawn contract forbids spawning from a bare name) — each running its own
  PoT-by-stance. Collect each subagent's `STANCE_RESULT`
  JSON, then feed them to the SAME Level-A merge + PMI. The skill supplies the persona loader and
  the merge/PMI; Claude supplies the fan-out. The 213 roster entries are personas, not instances —
  Level B is what turns a chosen persona into a genuinely concurrent instance. Cap N at
  `mental_interpreter.n_final` (or `config.max_parallel`).

## § 2.7 · Exploration, Chaos & Competence (per-mode)

- **Exploration policy (`config.exploration_policy(mode)`):** chaos agents start at **FOGGY**
  and parallelism switches from Level A to **Level B** from FOGGY up; **RESEARCH** forces a
  mandatory **genius stance**. P_chaos ceiling rises with the mode (0.10→0.30).
- **`scripts/chaos_operators.py`** (offensive chaos): `levy_step` (heavy-tail α=1.5 jumps that
  escape deep local minima), `structural_mutation` (rewrite the hypothesis's shape), `recombine`
  (cross two into a third), and `genius_stance` (the mandatory non-obvious hypothesis in
  RESEARCH). Chaos proposes; the PMI adjudicates — it never becomes the finding alone (SR_11).
- **`scripts/competence_matrix.py`** (metacognition / Op3): the agent×domain heat-map and the
  **persona-vs-skill-vs-rule diagnosis** — `diagnose(agent, domain, task, ...)` returns
  **PERSONA_SWAP** (stuck: rejections_streak>20 OR var(conf)<0.03 → reassign with phase_offset+π),
  **INJECT_SKILL** (low domain reward → forced_skill from native/marketplace), or **HARD_PROBLEM**
  (high difficulty via BehavioralDifficultyEstimator → escalate mode/attach the governing rule).
  `heatmap(agents, domain, task)` ranks the best agents for a domain — a helper the LLM/`mental_interpreter`/`deep_research` can call when choosing a panel (it is exposed, not auto-invoked).
- **`scripts/learning.py`** (Op-P3 — learning that persists): the durable promote/demote loop.
  `record_outcome(kind, subject, domain, success)` accumulates evidence per **(persona/skill/diff/
  rule/vaccine, domain)** and decides **PROMOTE / KEEP / DEMOTE** with the kernel's Bayesian layer
  (beta-binomial + Ω 0.72/0.5, ≥3 obs); every status change is mirrored to the **SHA-256 governance
  ledger** (`memory.record_event`) so it is durable + auditable. `best(kind, domain)` and the reward
  blended into `competence_matrix._reward` mean the NEXT task consults the validated cross-session
  history — a persona that keeps proving out is preferred, one that keeps failing is demoted.
  `evaluate_hypotheses` records each director's outcome automatically, so the loop closes itself.
- **`concurrent_executor.evaluate_hypotheses(task, hypotheses, directors, mode, subagent_hypotheses)`** —
  the analyst→directors flow, now with **maximized exploration** feeding the panel BEFORE it scores:
  1. **Level-B subagents (real LLM divergence):** the LLM-analyst raises the base hypotheses; when
     the mode uses Level-B parallelism (FOGGY↑) the result carries a **`spawn_subagents` manifest**
     naming which roster personas Claude should fan out as concurrent `Agent` subagents (one framing
     each — optimistic/pessimistic/neutral/contrarian, + **genius** in RESEARCH). Claude spawns them,
     collects their JSON, and re-calls with `subagent_hypotheses=[…]`; those merge in as first-class
     candidates.
  2. **Chaos expansion (`_chaos_expand`, FOGGY↑):** the offensive operators add divergent candidates
     the single-context LLM would not propose — a `chaos_*` structural mutation of the strongest
     hypothesis and a `chaos_recombine` child of the two most confident (each capped at conf ≤ 0.30,
     SR_11); **RESEARCH** appends the mandatory non-obvious `genius`.
  3. **Converge with rigor:** N specialist DIRECTORS (one per discipline, capped by the mode budget)
     score the full set by Bayesian posterior + difficulty + risk (FMEA/RPN) + persona/skill
     diagnosis, each emits a **SHA-256 laudo** `{ranking, best, confidence, justificativa,
     diagnostico}`; a BARRIER waits for all, then merge (entropy + PMI) → decision or RESTART. Gaps
     (missing skill/diff/rule, or wrong specialist) surface as `needs_correction` before adoption.
  The abort trigger in `run_stances` is re-anchored on the stuck mechanism (not a flat confidence cut).

## § 2.9 · Live Cross-Session Memory (`scripts/memory.py`, Op1)

The durable partner of the snapshot: a SQLite store (default `~/.apex-method/memory.db`) read
at session start and written INCREMENTALLY, so knowledge survives across sessions.
`remember(text, kind)` stores **semantic** facts (content-addressed by SHA-256 → deduped) or
**episodic** events (keyed by sha(text+ts+session) → distinct); `remember_from_snapshot()` is the
curated write (findings only, not every run). `recall(query, k)` = char-n-gram cosine top-k
(language-robust; sentence-transformers hook when present). `record_event(kind, subject, action)`
is the **governance ledger** — a SHA-256-chained, tamper-evident log the subsystems call when a
rule/diff/agent/skill/vaccine is promoted or demoted, mirrored into semantic memory so `recall`
surfaces the framework's own evolution. `verify_ledger()` re-walks the chain. Stdlib-only; a
MongoDB adapter can be plugged, SQLite is always the default.

**Knowledge Graph (B1).** Memories are not just rows — they carry TYPED edges, so retrieval
becomes a graph walk instead of a flat top-k. `relate(src_sha, dst_sha, rel)` (or `relate_text`)
adds an edge from the vocabulary `causa | contradiz | depende_de | refina | suporta`. The
DIRECTIONAL relations (`causa/depende_de/refina`) are kept **acyclic** — a cycle is a reasoning
error, rejected through the faithful `hypothesis_dag` engine before insert; the symmetric ones
(`contradiz/suporta`) may loop. `neighbors(sha, rel, direction)` and `walk(start, rel_types,
depth)` traverse; **`recall_graph(query, k, depth, rel)`** seeds with `recall` then EXPANDS along
the edges — answering "give me the fact AND everything that `contradiz` it", which a similarity
top-k cannot. Every edge is also written to the governance ledger, so the graph itself is durable,
auditable memory.

## § 2.8 · The Living Project Inventory (`scripts/project_ledger.py`)

For DEEP/SCIENTIFIC/RESEARCH projects that may span session interruptions (usage limits,
container recycling): a DURABLE ledger — a git-committed `PROJECT_LEDGER.md` (quick consult) +
JSON sidecar — so a fresh session resumes exactly. Each **micro-inventory** records WHO
(responsible persona) delivers WHAT (deliverable type: laudo/snapshot/pot_result/skill/diff/
doc/code/decision) to WHOM, WHEN = order in the **DSM** (dependency graph via `hypothesis_dag`:
`dsm()` gives the critical path + the parallelizable batches = process/cost optimization).
Governance: `guard_completion()` tells the LLM to finish the open micros before new scope;
`authorize_abandon(id, reason)` refuses to drop a mapped solution without a justified reason
(then flags a MACRO readjust). Persistence backends (user picks one): **git** commit, **local**
repo, or **zip** (`export_zip` bundles the ledger + competence.db/memory.db to re-upload on
resume). At FOGGY, `request_persistence()` prompts the user to choose. Only DEEP+ create a
ledger — lighter modes stay bureaucracy-free.

## § 2.10 · LLM Adapter — portability layer (`scripts/llm_adapter.py`, `meta/llm_compat.json`)

The runtime is model-agnostic: the kernel (method + scripts) never depends on one provider's
behaviour. **`meta/apex_llm.yaml`** is the authoritative **contract** (YAML; `meta/llm_compat.json`
is the stdlib fallback mirror) — what the kernel REQUIRES (tool_calling, subprocess_exec, structured
JSON, multi-turn; subagents + long_context optional), a per-mode context-window budget, a
per-provider capability matrix (claude/gpt/gemini/**deepseek**/local), **loop-prevention limits**
(`limits()`: max_iterations, max_restarts, min_progress, R_acum gates) and **optional accelerators**
(`requirements()`: numpy/scipy/scikit-learn/sympy — all environment-gated, skill works without them).
`llm_adapter.py` reads YAML when PyYAML is present (else the JSON) and answers before a run:
`check(provider)` (are the REQUIRED caps met?), `fits(provider, mode)` (window big enough?), and
**`degrade(provider, mode)`** → the concrete plan: `parallelism` **A vs B** (no native subagents →
Level A, ignore `spawn_subagents`), a **capped mode** when the window is too small, and manual
tool-loop / best-effort-JSON adjustments — announced, never silent. An unknown model falls back to
a conservative baseline (optional caps off, smallest window). `report(provider, mode)` bundles all
three. This is what makes the "same core across providers" claim real, not aspirational.

## § 2.11 · Swap store — durable memory hierarchy (`scripts/swap_store.py`)

The container is ephemeral, so working state must "page out" somewhere durable. `swap_store.py`
defines ONE standard, backend-agnostic layout — **identical on a local PC folder or in Google
Drive** — that behaves like an OS memory hierarchy: **RAM** (LLM context, dies) → **SWAP** (this
store, survives the container) → **DISK** (git, validated & permanent). Canonical tree:
`user/` (persona + preferences + input files — durable, user-owned), `memory/` (persistent
validated memory as NDJSON), `swap/<session>/` (ephemeral working state — disposable),
`staging/` (validated, queued for commit), `archive/` (superseded pages). `materialize(root)`
builds it locally (idempotent, never overwrites data); `drive_tree()` gives the runtime the same
schema to create on Drive (the script never touches Drive credentials — Claude uploads via the
Drive tools, exactly as project_ledger prepares a git commit). `export_bundle`/`import_bundle`
page a session out/in with a SHA-256 integrity hash (memory travels as portable NDJSON via
`MemoryStore.export()/load_rows()`, not a binary `.db`). **File standard:** every file is named
`<name>-<function>-<YYYYMMDDHHMMSS>-R<NN>.<ext>` (e.g. `memory-User-20260716183245-R00.json`) — the
timestamp versions each write, `R<NN>` is the file's **layout revision** (bump on schema change);
`latest()` always resolves the highest `(revision, ts)`, the MAIN folder holds it and older copies go
to `versions/`. **Rotation** keeps the newest `KEEP_BACKUPS` (10); older are deleted (local) or listed
for GC (Drive has no delete API). New users NEVER improvise the tree — it is built from the shipped
standard `models/apex_structure.model.json` (same on Windows or Drive), via `materialize(root)`
(local) or `drive_tree()` (the runtime creates it on Drive). **The promotion gate** — `is_validated`
+ `promotion_manifest` — is the rule that only what passes (PMI adopt **and** intact ledger
**and** tests) is promoted from swap to a git commit; everything else stays disposable in swap.

## § 2.12 · Execution routing contract + 3-persona entry (`scripts/execution_policy.py`)

The one rule that keeps the "cognitive runtime" honest: **discovery/research must never run in the
sealed sandbox.** `route(subtask)` classifies every micro-task onto a SURFACE — `subprocess`
(deterministic compute, NO internet), `agent` (LLM reasoning), or `agent+internet` (discovery:
skills.sh, repos, papers, MCPs — a subagent WITH web tools) — and emits `needs_internet` +
`provider_of_tools: "llm-orchestrator"`. **HARD RULE (enforced in code):** `needs_internet=True` is
never routed to `subprocess`. The LLM orchestrator ALWAYS provides the tools — it discovers, vets
(AST-scan + H5 approval), and hands each instance its concrete skill/persona; the sandbox only runs
already-provided code. This is a machine-checkable manifest, deliberately **not a DSL** (less to
misread). `dissect_entry(task, mode)` is the formalized ENTRY: it raises the **3 dissect personas**
(architect → decompose macro→micro; analyst → SWOT + governance + resolve tools native→skills.sh→
create; critic → challenge persona/tool/template), and for each micro returns SWOT, the needed
agents/skills/tools (durable-best via `learning`), the resolution plan, the **routing**, a document
**template** (so nothing is generic), and region-specific **governance** when the problem is
regulated (HIPAA/GDPR/LGPD/financial/legal…). Reuses `orchestrator.dissect`/`assign_specialists`,
`gravity.plan`, `repo_bridge`, `learning` — no discovery is reimplemented.
**Triage (token economy + MCFE escalation):** `triage(task, reliability)` runs FIRST — a **trivial
task skips the whole pipeline** (`orchestrator.express_check` → EXPRESS, ~400 tokens), a
**low-difficulty** task stays light (capped at STANDARD), and a **hard** task
(`competence_matrix.estimate_difficulty` ≥ 0.85) OR a **low MCFE reliability** signal (bayes R_acum
gate < 0.50) **escalates the mode and flips reasoning micros to `agent+internet`** — go DISCOVER
better tools/context. Compute always stays `subprocess` (you never send RK4 to the internet).
`dissect_entry(task, mode, reliability)` short-circuits when triage says skip. This is now wired into
`orchestrator.run` — a hard problem escalates the mode even without a discipline-keyword hit.
**Loop guard:** `loop_guard(iteration, progress_history, restarts, reliability)` reads the
`apex_llm.yaml` limits and returns STOP when iterations/restarts exceed the cap, reliability drops
under the early-exit gate, or there is no progress for 2 rounds — so the LLM can never spin.
`orchestrator.run` never raises: any unexpected failure returns an `ERROR_DEGRADED` result.

**MODE FLOOR — the pipeline is not optional (v1.39).** A skill the LLM can silently skip is useless.
`mode_floor(task)` forces the pipeline for whole task classes: **audit / security / compliance /
forensic** never skip and run **≥ DEEP**. When `estimate_difficulty` does NOT recognize the problem
class it returns `uncertain=True` (bde 0.70, no silent 0.5) → triage escalates to DEEP AND sets
`require_dissect_personas=True` (the 3 dissect personas MUST establish the real difficulty before
proceeding). The user can pin a hard global floor with `menu.py set min_mode DEEP` — then EVERY task
runs the pipeline. This is what stops the LLM from choosing EXPRESS when it shouldn't.

**PERSISTENCE TRIGGER — page out at session end (v1.39).** For DEEP/SCIENTIFIC/RESEARCH,
`orchestrator.run` returns `persist_due` and you MUST act on it before ending: call
`swap_store.page_out(session_id, memory_db, snapshot)` (writes versioned files into `swap/<session>/`
+ builds a `drive_manifest`), then **upload the manifest to `APEX/swap/<session>/` on Drive** (the
`drive-swap` backend) and print the returned `log` so the user sees it happened. `menu.py persist
[session] [backend]` is the explicit on-demand trigger. Nothing is silent — the page-out is always logged.

## § 3 · Finding and Using an External Skill (safe flow)

Mirrors the awesome-skills install pattern ("read a SKILL.md URL"), done safely.

0. **Native first** — `repo_bridge.search_native(need)` checks the 3,784 native APEX skills;
   a hit is loaded with `native_skill(path)` (no install needed, still data until vetted).
1. **Route** — `router.py` against the need (e.g. a frontend UX/UI skill for a UI task,
   a brainstorm skill for a new idea). For gaps, `gravity.plan()` emits a discovery request
   with a **skills.sh search URL** and a **GitHub search URL** (Claude may run these with its
   web tools) and the action `ASK_USER_TO_APPROVE_INSTALL` — Claude presents the candidate to
   the user and only proceeds (`npx skills add owner/repo`) after explicit approval (H5).
2. **Scout & evaluate** — `skill_scout.py <raw SKILL.md url>`: parses structure, checks it
   documents triggers/scope, and **AST-scans any shipped code** in two tiers: it hard-**rejects**
   RCE vectors (`exec`/`eval`/`__import__`, `os.system`, pickle/marshal/yaml deserializers) →
   `safe=False`; and **flags for review** the often-benign-but-risky (`subprocess`, `getattr`,
   any non-whitelisted import). A non-whitelisted import also makes it **not auto-safe**
   (`safe=False`), so obfuscated `getattr(os,'system')`/`subprocess` cannot slip through as safe.
   The scanner is best-effort static (see §12) — the human H5 approval is the real boundary.
3. **Stage into the snapshot** — records the skill id, `use_when`, and call signature under
   `snapshot.skills_staged` with `status: STAGED`.
4. **Gate** — installing/running requires explicit user approval. Claude never silently
   installs or executes fetched code.

## § 4 · Agent Catalog (personas with competence)

APEX agents are **lean persona records that become fully executable at spawn time** (v1.43):
`agent_spawn.spawn(agent_id, task)` assumes the real persona (AGENT.md), attracts real
skills/diffs/scripts via the precomputed attraction graph, merges the durable grants and
learning history, and returns the executable AgentSpec the host instantiates as a real
subagent. When a skill is scouted and **approved**, `agent_registry.grant_skill` equips it
DURABLY (persists by default, survives reload, revocable via `revoke_grant`/`unequip`) — so
installing a skill upgrades the relevant agents with new tools/scripts, and the memory of
what each agent equipped stays correlated with the library. Full detail in
`references/agents.md`.

- `agent_registry.match_task_to_agents(task)` — pick the best of the 11 core personas.
- `agent_registry.match_task_to_ext_agents(task)` — route to the best of **all 213 real APEX
  agents** (`catalog/apex_agents_roster.json`; the 30 `community-awesome` agents the old
  roster missed are now included).
- `agent_registry.grant_skill(skill, agents, approved)` — grant an APPROVED skill;
  returns BLOCKED if not approved (APEX H5).
- Catalogs: `catalog/agents_catalog.json` (roster), `catalog/skills_catalog.json` (430 real
  skills, fetchable raw URLs), `catalog/curated_skills.json` (best-in-class skills per domain
  from skills.sh + dedicated repos). `scripts/curated.py` pre-maps curated skills to agents.

## § 10 · Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns

- Treating "perspectives/agents" as parallel cognition — they are sequential stances.
- Calling qualitative weighting "Monte Carlo" — only use that term when the experiment
  is actually codable and simulated.
- Running `run_parallel()` on fast steps — the ThreadPool overhead exceeds the gain.
- Routing across languages with TF-IDF — it is lexical; keep catalog and task in the
  same language or swap in real embeddings.
- Trusting a low-confidence router hit — `router.route` now DEMOTES auto-generated name-stub
  skills (e.g. "Expert skill for T-Mobile") so lexical name collisions ("mobile"→t-mobile) cannot
  win; use `router.route_confident(...)` which returns `NO_RELIABLE_SKILL` when nothing clears the
  confidence floor (stage a discovery/install instead of surfacing noise).
- Auto-installing internet skills — forbidden; always stage + approve.

## § 11 · Integration with Other Skills

Composes with any awesome-skills persona/tool skill: use `router.py` + `skill_scout.py`
to discover, evaluate, and stage them, then load the vetted SKILL.md. Pairs naturally with
`workflow/engineering` skills (TDD, debug-diagnose) and domain personas.

## § 12 · Scope & Limitations

- Not parallel agents; not a system that reprograms Claude.
- Not cross-session persistence — the snapshot lives in conversation context and must be
  re-read on resume.
- The AST scanner is a best-effort static gate, not a sandbox; the human approval gate is
  the real boundary.
- Router is lexical (TF-IDF), so cross-language discovery can miss.

## § 13 · Trigger Words

APEX, PoT, program of thought, pipeline, scientific mode, modo científico, RK4, token
budget, operating mode, decompose, root cause, FMEA, Ishikawa, Pareto, DSM, formal verify,
skill router, audit, autopsy, structured reasoning.

## § 14 · Quality Verification

### Test Cases

1. "Integrate a 2D oscillator and check energy conservation" → SCIENTIFIC; RK4 error ~1e-7
   vs Euler ~1e2 (see EVALUATION_REPORT.md).
2. "Is (x+1)² = x²+2x+1?" → `verify.py` → FORMAL_VERIFIED; the false variant → FORMAL_REFUTED.
3. "Find a frontend UX/UI skill" → `router.py` ranks the frontend skill first; `skill_scout.py`
   stages it after AST scan.
4. "Check this while-True function" → `uco_gate.py` → REJECTED (loop risk).
